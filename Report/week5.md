## OSProject - toaruOS

An operating systems project on understanding and solving issues for the open source OS - [toaruOS](https://github.com/klange/toaruos).



During this week, our main focus was to go head with the coding part and develop the program which allows us to open the image file and also gives us the pointers to the root directory location in the File Allocation Table to be able to operate on it.
