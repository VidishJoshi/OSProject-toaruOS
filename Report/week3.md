## OSProject - toaruOS

An operating systems project on understanding and solving issues for the open source OS - [toaruOS](https://github.com/klange/toaruos).

This repository and read me contains the work done, issues faced and implementation done by us on the original OS. These steps will be
similar in some cases to that of the original OS and different in some others.

## Plan for next week

Read and understand the Microsoft documentation for FAT32 system.

Along with it, start coding the blocks that are understood. Refer to the documentation whenever necessary. 

The following link is also useful along with the documentation as it explains concepts very clearly:

* [https://www.pjrc.com/tech/8051/ide/fat32.html](https://www.pjrc.com/tech/8051/ide/fat32.html)

This YouTube lecture series is good. Great explanation + implementation is done in this series. Refer this in the coming week.
